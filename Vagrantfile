# Vagrantfile for DSpace Development
# 
# WARNING: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT DOES NOT YET FULLY INSTALL DSPACE VIA VAGRANT!
#  
# DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION. THIS IS FOR DEVELOPMENT/TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
#
# Currently, this config only sets up the following via Vagrant
#   * Setup SSH Key Forwarding (from local machine to Vagrant VM)
#   * Setup basic Git settings (email & username) on VM
#   * Install Java, Maven, Ant on VM
#   * Checkout DSpace source code from GitHub to VM
#
# ONLY TESTED with VirtualBox provider. Your mileage may vary with other providers

    config.ssh.forward_agent = true


    # THIS NEXT PART IS TOTAL HACK (only necessary for running Vagrant on Windows)
    # Windows currently doesn't support SSH Forwarding when running Vagrant's "Provisioning scripts" 
    # (e.g. all the "config.vm.provision" commands below). Although running "vagrant ssh" (from Windows commandline) 
    # will work for SSH Forwarding once the VM has started up, "config.vm.provision" commands in this Vagrantfile DO NOT.
    # Supposedly there's a bug in 'net-ssh' gem (used by Vagrant) which causes SSH forwarding to fail on Windows only
    # See: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1735
    #      https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1404
    # See also underlying 'net-ssh' bug: https://github.com/net-ssh/net-ssh/issues/55
    #
    # Therefore, we have to "hack it" and manually sync our SSH keys to the Vagrant VM & copy them over to the 'root' user account
    # (as 'root' is the account that runs all Vagrant "config.vm.provision" scripts below). This all means 'root' should be able 
    # to connect to GitHub as YOU! Once this Windows bug is fixed, we should be able to just remove these lines and everything 
    # should work via the "config.ssh.forward_agent=true" setting.
    # ONLY do this hack/workaround if the local OS is Windows.
    if Vagrant::Util::Platform.windows?
        # MORE SECURE HACK. You MUST have a ~/.ssh/github_rsa (GitHub specific) SSH key to copy to VM
        # (ensures we are not just copying all your local SSH keys to a VM)
