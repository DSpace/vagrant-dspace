# default.yaml - Default settings for vagrant-dspace
#
# This is the default settings for 'vagrant-dspace'. If you wish to override or change
# these settings, you can copy this file into a "local.yaml" and modify whatever settings
# you see fit. Any settings which are not in your "local.yaml" or are commented out will
# default to whatever is in "default.yaml"
#
# By default, anytime Puppet is run, the /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml config file will load
# the settings in BOTH the "default.yaml" and "local.yaml". The settings in "local.yaml"
# will always override the default settings.

#-----------------------------
# Vagrant Settings
#-----------------------------
# Name of the VM to create in VirtualBox
#(Also the name of the subfolder in ~/VirtualBox VMs/ where this VM is normally kept)
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant destroy && vagrant up' to take effect)
vm_name    : 'dspace-dev'

# How much memory to provide to VirtualBox VM (in MB)
# Provide 2GB of memory by default
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant reload' to take effect)
vm_memory  : 2048

# Maximum amount of host CPU which VirtualBox VM can use (in %)
# The example below would only let VM use up to 50% of host CPU
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant reload' to take effect)
#vm_max_cpu : 50

# Local IP address which will refer to this VM
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant reload' to take effect)
ip_address : 192.168.50.2

# Local port which will access DSpace/Tomcat on this VM
# NOTE: if this port is already in use, Vagrant will use the next available port between 8081 and 8100
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant reload' to take effect)
port       : 8080

# Local port which will access PostgreSQL on this VM
# This allows you to access the VM's DSpace database via pgAdminIII, or even debug code
# (via a locally installed IDE) while using this database.
# NOTE: if this port is already in use, Vagrant will use the next available port between 8081 and 8100
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant reload' to take effect)
db_port    : 5432

# Whether to sync the ~/dspace-src/ (DSpace Source) to the host machine
# (under [vagrant-dspace]/dspace-src/).
#   * Setting to "true" means the local copy & VM copy are always in sync, and
#     you can use an IDE to edit your source code. BUT, the *first* 'vagrant up'
#     WILL take significantly longer (e.g. ~45mins instead of 10-15mins). 
#     Subsequent 'vagrant up' calls will use existing local source (until deleted).
#   * Setting to "false" is much more speedy, but you then can ONLY edit code
#     directly on the VM (i.e. no direct IDE integration)
# By default this is "false" to keep things speedy.
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant destroy && vagrant up' to take effect)
sync_src_to_host : false

# Default Vagrant "box" to use. This should be an Ubuntu box (12.04 or 14.04 recommended)
# as 'vagrant-dspace' has not been tested on other OSes.
# (Changes to these settings require a 'vagrant destroy && vagrant up' to take effect)

# Boot VM into GUI mode (login: vagrant, pwd: vagrant). Useful for debugging VM boot issues, etc.
# By default this is disabled as it can be memory hungry, and SSH is usually all you need.
# (Changes to this setting require a 'vagrant reload' to take effect)
vm_gui_mode     : false

#-----------------------------
# DSpace Source Code settings
#-----------------------------
# By default, we are always grabbing the DSpace Source code from GitHub
# We use the "master" branch by default.
# NOTE: While this defaults to using the SSH GitHub URL, if the SSH connection fails
# it will be dynamically changed into the HTTPS GitHub URL (https://github.com/[user]/[proj])
# You may also change "git_repo" to an HTTPS URL in order to force HTTPS at all times.
# (Changes to these settings require a 'vagrant destroy && vagrant up' to take effect)
git_repo          : 'git@github.com:DSpace/DSpace.git'

#-------------------------------
# DSpace Administrative Account
#-------------------------------
# Initial Admin account to auto-create for DSpace
# After DSpace starts, you will be able to immediately login using the specified "admin_email" and "admin_passwd"
# (Changes to these settings require a 'vagrant provision' to take effect)

#------------------------------
# DSpace Build/Install settings
#------------------------------
# Java version to install/use (valid values = 6 or 7)
# NOTE: OpenJDK is always installed for vagrant-dspace
# (This setting is only used during a "vagrant up")
dspace::java_version : '7'

# Maven Defaults
#
# IF you want to exclude particular webapps from building & installing, you can do so like:
# mvn_params: '-P!dspace-lni,!dspace-rdf'
# (This setting is only used during a 'vagrant up')
mvn_params        : ''

# Ant Defaults
# NOTE: if you change 'git_branch' above, you MAY need to modify this 'ant_installer_dir'
# setting. It must be set to the directory where the Ant-based installer ends up, after
# 'mvn package' is run.
# By default this is commented out, as it is always the same location for DSpace 5 or above.
# (This setting is only used during a 'vagrant up')
#ant_installer_dir : '/home/vagrant/dspace-src/dspace/target/dspace-installer'

# Tomcat Defaults
#
# We use Ubuntu, so these are all Ubuntu defaults. Don't change them.
# (Except where specified, these settings are only used during a 'vagrant up')
# Tomcat Package to install
tomcat_package    : 'tomcat7'
# Name of default Tomcat service
